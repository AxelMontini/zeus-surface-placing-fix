Surface Placing Fix by Axel Montini - Fixes Zeus placing of objects.

To enable use _handler = [] execVM "SurfacePlacingFix\initSurfacePlacingFix.sqf"; in the file init.sqf;
then copy the scripts folder 

You can omit parameters or use some, according to the documentation at the top of the sqf file.
Default placing method is unreliable with vehicles (sometimes), but it gets the job done:
PLACE SH*T ON ROOFS, ON CARRIERS, EVEN IN ZEUS MODE! No more place & ALT+DRAG to bring them where you want!

To use area-dependant parameters, you MUST give as attribute A TRIGGER, with custom dimensions.
Also as first parameter you must choose a mode.
